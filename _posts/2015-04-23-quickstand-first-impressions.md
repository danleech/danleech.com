Yesterday I recieved a [Humanscale QuickStand](http://global.humanscale.com/products/product_detail.cfm?group=quickstand) sit-stand desk device to try. It’s an attempt to provide sit-stand functionality to existing desks. I’ll be trying it out for a while and wanted to note down some initial thoughts.

## Pros

- The maximum height is perfect for me to stand at. I’m just over 6ft tall. Taller people in my office have tried it and found the screen to be too low for them.
- The display bracket (I have the single-screen model) supports my heavy [Dell U2711](http://www.dell.com/ae/business/p/dell-u2711/pd) with ease.
- The fit and finish is excellent.
- It’s easy to assemble and install.

## Cons

- It wobbles when at standing height. I mean it _really_ wobbles.
- It comes with pre-routed cables for power, single-link DVI and USB. Single-link DVI doesn’t support high-resolution displays like mine, so I have a separate DisplayPort cable dangling over the side.
- At sitting height, because of the tilted riser rail, the screen sits right in the middle of my 800mm desk. That’s way too close to my eyes. No wonder Humanscale recommend buying an extra keyboard tray in their promotional video!
- My laptop doesn’t travel with my workspace. I often find myself looking down at it, which can’t be good for my neck.

The unit seems to retail for around £600. That’s around half the price of Humanscale’s sit-stand desk, the [Float](http://global.humanscale.com/products/product_detail.cfm?group=float), which includes a whole desk as well.
