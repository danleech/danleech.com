## About me

### Hi. I’m Dan.

I’m a product designer in the healthcare industry, improving the delivery of medicines and services to patients. I work with healthcare professionals and managers to understand their needs and challenges. Using what I learn, I can design products and processes to support them.

I love to climb and hike. Wherever I travel, you’ll find me seeking out the highest mountains in the area so I can check out the views from the top.

I’m keen to work with any company that invests in good design to improve the quality of life for as many people as possible.
